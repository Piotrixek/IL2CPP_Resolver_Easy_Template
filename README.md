# IL2CPP_Resolver_Easy_Template
This project provides a simple template for working with IL2CPP-based games. It includes functionalities for finding and interacting with game objects, invoking methods, and modifying fields. The project serves as a starting point for those new to IL2CPP and game hacking.

**Features**:

- Printing player and mob instances with their positions and rotations.
- Invoking methods on game objects (e.g., making players jump).
- Modifying fields on game objects (e.g., setting player movement speed).
- Continuous caching of player and mob instances.

**To-Do**:
- Fix the issue with retrieving and displaying the rotation of game objects for easy and fast aimbot setup. 
- Add more examples of interacting with different game objects and methods.
- Provide more detailed comments and documentation for each function.
- Add more key bindings for different functionalities.
- Implement a cleaner and more modular code structure.
- Imgui

  **Problems**
  doesn't work shortcut? sometimes you need to go to your created console and press any key on keyboard and it will continue.

**Getting Started**:
This template is intended to help beginners understand the basics of working with IL2CPP and game hacking. The project includes example code for common tasks such as finding objects, invoking methods, and setting fields.
